# book-catalog
The Book Catalog is a web application built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and HTML/CSS. It allows users to manage a collection of books, including adding new books, viewing the list of all books, editing existing books, and deleting books. Users can also search for books by title, author, or genre. This project provides a basic introduction to web development using Python's Flask framework and database management with SQLAlchemy.
